# 💼 SDFPP Resume Project – [Sean John Feresi]

## 📖 About the Project

This is my completed project for the Software Development Foundations Portfolio Project (SDFPP). The task was to create a fully responsive online resume using only HTML and CSS, based on a Figma design file.

The result is a personal website that showcases who I am, what I can do, and how I write clean, structured, and responsive code. It’s the first portfolio piece I’m proud to show to future employers.

## 🔧 Tools & Tech Used

- HTML 
- CSS
- Flexbox & CSS Grid  
- Git & GitHub  
- Figma (for design reference)  
- VS Code

---

## 🎨 Project Features

The site includes the following sections, all matching the design reference as closely as possible:

- ✅ Profile & Summary  
- ✅ Proficiency Bars  
- ✅ Skills Tags  
- ✅ Projects Grid  
- ✅ Education & Work History  
- ✅ Tools Section  
- ✅ Footer  

Everything was built from scratch with semantic HTML and responsive CSS. I used Flexbox and Grid layouts to keep things structured and fluid on smaller screen sizes.

## 📱 Responsiveness

The layout adapts to:

- Mobile phones (402px and below)  
- Laptops and desktops

I used Desktop-first media queries because i found it easier to scale down the up.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and improved:

- Writing semantic, accessible HTML  
- Structuring clean CSS  
- Using Flexbox and Grid for layouts  
- Following a Figma design closely  
- Building Desktop-first and responsive designs  
- Version control with Git and clean commit practices

This gave me real-world experience turning a professional design into working code.
